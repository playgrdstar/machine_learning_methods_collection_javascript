# A collection of machine learning methods implemented in Javascript

I implemented a whole collection of machine learning methods in Javascript, visualised in D3.js. These include:
- linear regression
- linear regression with stochastic gradient descent
- logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent
- linear discriminant analysis
- CART
- naive bayes
- KNN classifier
- support vector machine
- bagging
- boosting
